## Development Dependencies

- **Linting & Code Quality**:
  - ESLint, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, `eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort`
  - Husky for pre-commit hooks
  - lint-staged for staged file management
- **Mocking & Testing**:
  - MirageJS for API mocking
  - FakerJS for mock data generation
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript ~5.6.2
- **Tooling**: Vite with `@vitejs/plugin-react`

## Features Implemented
- **User Dashboard**:
  - Fetch mockdata user data via MirageJS
  - Mock data generated by Faker
  - Diplay virtiualized list of users in `ag-grid` table
  - Display charts (Age distribution / City Distibution) bar charts in sync with the latest data in the data store
  - Contextual buttons for user operations on every row
  - Table Sort, filtering and search happens on the frontend, driven by the OOB features provided `ag-grid`
- **User Create / Edit / Delete**
  - A full screen popup for distraction free UX
  - Frontend validation of form fields with targetted error messages and visual cues (zod and formik)
  - Automatically updates the data model after every create/edit operation done by tages defined in RTK query
  - Visual Indication for api status (loading / error / success)
  - Redux state to hold the CRUD status of the user
  - Accessibilty of form components with aria labelling and proper html semantics when needed
- **Dark Mode Toggle**
  - Ability to toggle the dark mode in browser.
  - The ag-grid is specially themed to handle dark mode via mui,
  - The charts are themed in the same way too.
- **Code Quality**
  - es-lints integrated, with import sort and format on save.
  - husky and lint staged used to ensure the committed code is always properly formatted.
- **Responsive Design**
  - Use mui's Gridv2 system to layout the application
  - Mobile frst responsive design implemented, can be enhanced for XXL screens
  - The table column widths also setup with flex and percentage based sizing
- **Code structure**
  - Takes a faux [feature slice](https://dev.to/m_midas/feature-sliced-design-the-best-frontend-architecture-4noj) based approach, where each new feature will be defined on its dedicatd folder
  - Files are very explicitly named for easy understanding
  - Decoupled components built to facilitate confusion free unit testing 
  - Codes are deliberately kept to minimum to leverage functionality provided by the npm packages to its best.
  - Attempted to follow as much as possible Conventional commits for commit messages. (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- **CI/CD integration**
  - Set CI/CD with Github actions via github workflow actions
  - Automatically builds and deploys to Github pages when a commit to the `main`branch is made

## Known Limitations
- The visx charts are made to be responsive, but in smaller width screens the labels on the x-axis overlap, It requires investing more time to fix.
- The repo is deliberately named as Heart Beat to avoid conflicting with intended company's name

## Conclusion

The project is a modern **React** and **TypeScript** application:
- **Vite** ensures fast performance.
- **Material-UI** and **Emotion** provide styling solutions.
- **Redux Toolkit** handles state management.
- Robust development workflows with **linting**, **testing**, and **pre-commit hooks** ensure code quality and maintainability.
